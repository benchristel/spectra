# Spectra

Spectra is a very simple webpage for displaying a rotating
set of messages on an information radiator (e.g. a CI
monitor in a shared workspace).

Its goals include:

- Welcoming people with messages of inclusion
- Provoking thought and research into topics that viewers
  might not otherwise have considered.

It is part of a grassroots diversity & inclusion initiative
at the Pivotal Palo Alto office. (Standard disclaimer: the
views represented here are my own, not those of Pivotal;
